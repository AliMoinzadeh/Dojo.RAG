# Coffee Bean Origins and Terroir

## Understanding Coffee Origins

Like wine, coffee exhibits terroir - the influence of geography, climate, and processing on flavor. Single-origin coffees showcase the unique characteristics of their growing region.

## Major Growing Regions

- Grading: AA, AB (bean size)
- Processing: Washed (wet) process
- Notes: Blackcurrant, tomato, citrus

### Central America

**Guatemala**

## Processing Methods

Processing dramatically affects flavor:

### Washed (Wet) Process
1. Fruit removed immediately
2. Fermented to remove mucilage
3. Washed and dried
4. **Result**: Clean, bright, acidic

### Natural (Dry) Process
1. Whole cherries dried in sun
2. Fruit contact during drying
3. Hulled after drying
4. **Result**: Fruity, sweet, heavy body

### Honey Process
1. Skin removed, mucilage remains
2. Dried with varying mucilage amounts
3. Color indicates level (yellow, red, black)
4. **Result**: Balance of washed and natural

## Altitude and Quality

Higher altitude = slower growth = denser beans = more complex flavors

| Altitude | Classification |
|----------|----------------|
| < 900m | Low grown |
| 900-1,200m | Medium grown |
| 1,200-1,500m | High grown |
| > 1,500m | Strictly high grown |

## Specialty Coffee Scoring

The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) uses a 100-point scale:

- **90+**: Outstanding
- **85-89**: Excellent
- **80-84**: Very good (specialty threshold)
- **Below 80**: Commodity grade

Evaluation criteria:
- Fragrance/aroma
- Flavor
- Aftertaste
- Acidity
- Body
- Balance
- Uniformity
- Clean cup
- Sweetness
