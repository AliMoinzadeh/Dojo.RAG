# Cold Brew Coffee: Low and Slow

## What Makes Cold Brew Different?

Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarse grounds in cold or room temperature water for an extended period (12-24 hours). This produces a concentrate that's fundamentally different from iced coffee.

## The Chemistry of Cold Extraction

Temperature dramatically affects extraction:

| Compound Type | Hot Water | Cold Water |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Caffeine | Fast extraction | Slow extraction |
| Acids | High extraction | Low extraction |
| Oils | High extraction | Moderate |
| Sugars | Fast | Slow |

Cold water extracts fewer acidic compounds, resulting in:
- 67% less acidity than hot brew
- Smoother, sweeter flavor profile
- Less bitterness
- Different aroma compounds

## Cold Brew vs Iced Coffee

**Cold Brew**:
- Brewed cold from start
- 12-24 hour steep time
- Concentrated, diluted to serve
- Smooth, sweet, low acid

**Iced Coffee**:
- Hot brewed, then chilled
- Standard brewing time
- Full strength or double-strength
- Bright, acidic, aromatic

## Basic Cold Brew Recipe

### Ingredients
- 100g coarsely ground coffee
- 500ml filtered water
- Yields ~400ml concentrate

### Process
1. Combine grounds and water in a jar
2. Stir to ensure all grounds are wet
3. Cover and refrigerate for 12-18 hours
4. Strain through a fine mesh sieve
5. Filter through paper for clarity
6. Store concentrate up to 2 weeks

### Serving
Dilute concentrate 1:1 or 1:2 with water, milk, or ice

## Immersion vs Cold Drip

### Immersion (Traditional)
- Grounds steep in water
- Simple equipment
- Full, rounded flavor
- Slightly cloudy

### Cold Drip (Dutch/Kyoto Style)
- Water slowly drips through grounds
- Complex tower apparatus
- Cleaner, brighter notes
- Crystal clear

## Nitro Cold Brew

Infusing cold brew with nitrogen creates:
- Creamy, cascading texture
- Sweet perception without sugar
- Guinness-like foam head
- Silky mouthfeel

## Best Beans for Cold Brew

Choose beans with:
- Chocolate and nut notes
- Lower acidity origins (Brazil, Sumatra)
- Medium to dark roast
- Natural or honey processed

Avoid:
- Light roasts (under-extract)
- Fruity/floral profiles (muted by cold)
- Very old beans

## Storage and Shelf Life

| Type | Refrigerated | Room Temp |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Concentrate | 2 weeks | 1-2 days |
| Diluted | 3-4 days | Don't store |
| Nitro | 1 week | N/A |
