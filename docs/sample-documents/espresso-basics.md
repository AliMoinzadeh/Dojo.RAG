# Espresso: The Foundation of Modern Coffee

## What is Espresso?

Espresso is a concentrated coffee brewing method that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It uses high pressure (typically 9 bars) to force hot water through finely ground coffee beans, extracting a rich, flavorful shot in just 25-30 seconds.

## The Science Behind Espresso

The espresso brewing process relies on several key factors:

1. **Pressure**: 9 bars of pressure forces water through the tightly packed coffee grounds
2. **Temperature**: Water temperature between 90-96°C (195-205°F) is optimal
3. **Grind Size**: Extra-fine grind increases surface area for extraction
4. **Dose**: Typically 18-21 grams of coffee for a double shot

## Crema: The Signature of Quality

The golden-brown layer on top of espresso is called crema. It consists of:
- CO2 released during extraction
- Oils from the coffee beans
- Proteins that stabilize the foam

Good crema should be 2-3mm thick and persist for 2-3 minutes.

## Extraction Variables

Under-extraction results in sour, thin shots. This happens when:
- Grind is too coarse
- Water temperature is too low
- Shot time is too short

Over-extraction produces bitter, harsh flavors when:
- Grind is too fine
- Water temperature is too high
- Shot time is too long

## Popular Espresso Drinks

- **Americano**: Espresso diluted with hot water
- **Cappuccino**: Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam
- **Latte**: Espresso with a larger portion of steamed milk
- **Macchiato**: Espresso "marked" with a small amount of foam
