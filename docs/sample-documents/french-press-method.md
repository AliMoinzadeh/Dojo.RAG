# French Press: Full Immersion Brewing

## History and Design

The French Press (also called cafetière or coffee plunger) was patented by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929. It consists of a cylindrical carafe, a plunger with a metal mesh filter, and a lid.

## Why Choose French Press?

French press offers unique advantages:

- **Full extraction**: All coffee oils pass through the metal filter
- **Rich body**: Creates a heavy, full-bodied cup
- **Simplicity**: No paper filters or complex equipment
- **Versatility**: Works for coffee, tea, and cold brew
- **Affordability**: Low cost entry into specialty coffee

## Brewing Parameters

### Grind Size
Coarse grind is essential - similar to sea salt texture. Fine grounds will:
- Pass through the filter (sludge)
- Over-extract (bitter taste)
- Make pressing difficult

### Water Temperature
195-205°F (90-96°C) - just below boiling

### Brew Time
4 minutes total immersion time

### Ratio
1:15 to 1:17 (coffee to water)
- Strong: 1:12
- Standard: 1:15
- Light: 1:17

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Preheat** the carafe with hot water
2. **Add** coarsely ground coffee
3. **Pour** half the water, ensuring all grounds are wet
4. **Stir** gently after 30 seconds
5. **Add** remaining water
6. **Place** lid (without pressing)
7. **Wait** 4 minutes total
8. **Press** slowly and steadily
9. **Pour** immediately to prevent over-extraction

## The James Hoffmann Method

Coffee expert James Hoffmann popularized a modified technique:

1. Use the same initial steps
2. At 4 minutes, break the crust with a spoon
3. Scoop off the foam and floating grounds
4. Wait another 5-8 minutes for grounds to settle
5. Press gently, just to filter level
6. Pour without agitating

This produces a cleaner cup with less sediment.

## Common Mistakes

- **Pressing too hard**: Creates pressure that extracts bitterness
- **Leaving coffee in the press**: Continue extraction causes over-extraction
- **Using pre-ground coffee**: Pre-ground is too fine and goes stale quickly
- **Boiling water**: Too hot extracts harsh compounds

## Cleaning Tips

- Disassemble the plunger regularly
- Remove all trapped grounds
- Avoid dish soap (leaves residue)
- Air dry completely
