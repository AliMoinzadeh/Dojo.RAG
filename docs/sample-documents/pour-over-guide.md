# Pour-Over Coffee: The Art of Manual Brewing

## Introduction to Pour-Over

Pour-over is a manual coffee brewing method that gives you complete control over every variable in the brewing process. Unlike automatic drip machines, pour-over allows you to adjust water flow, temperature, and timing to extract the perfect cup.

## Essential Equipment

### Drippers
- **Hario V60**: Conical shape with spiral ridges and a large hole
- **Chemex**: Elegant glass vessel with thick filters
- **Kalita Wave**: Flat-bottom design for consistent extraction
- **Melitta**: Classic cone shape with small drain holes

### Other Tools
- Gooseneck kettle for precise pouring
- Scale with timer
- Fresh, filtered water
- Quality burr grinder

## The Bloom Phase

The bloom is crucial for pour-over success:

1. Add coffee grounds to the filter
2. Pour just enough water to saturate the grounds (2x coffee weight)
3. Wait 30-45 seconds while CO2 escapes
4. Fresh coffee will "bloom" and expand dramatically

The bloom ensures even extraction by releasing trapped gases that would otherwise create channeling.

## Pouring Technique

### Concentric Circles
Pour in slow, steady circles starting from the center and moving outward. Avoid pouring directly on the filter walls.

### Pulse Pouring vs Continuous Pour
- **Pulse pouring**: Multiple small pours with pauses
- **Continuous pour**: Steady stream throughout

Both techniques have advocates. Pulse pouring gives more control; continuous pouring creates consistent flow.

## Brew Ratios

Standard pour-over ratio: 1:15 to 1:17 (coffee to water)

| Coffee (g) | Water (ml) | Ratio |
|------------|------------|-------|
| 15 | 250 | 1:16.7 |
| 20 | 320 | 1:16 |
| 30 | 500 | 1:16.7 |

## Total Brew Time

Target: 3-4 minutes total

- If too fast: grind finer
- If too slow: grind coarser

## Flavor Characteristics

Pour-over produces a clean, bright cup that highlights:
- Origin characteristics
- Delicate flavor notes
- Tea-like body
- Aromatic complexity
